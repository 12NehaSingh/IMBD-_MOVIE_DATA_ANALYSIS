# IMBD-_MOVIE_DATA_ANALYSIS
Movie Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing movie data from the "IMDB-Movie-Data.csv" dataset. The dataset contains information about various movies, including their title, director, genre, ratings, revenue, and other attributes. The script performs several data analysis tasks and generates visualizations to gain insights from the dataset.

# Requirements

 To run the script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:


1.pandas

2.matplotlib

3.seaborn

4.collection

# You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Usage

Download the "IMDB-Movie-Data.csv" dataset and place it in the same directory as the script.

Run the Python script, and it will perform various data analysis tasks on the dataset.

# Tasks Performed

1.Displaying the top 10 rows and last 10 rows of the dataset.

2.Getting information about the dataset, such as its shape, data types of each column, and memory requirement.

3.Checking for null values in the dataset and displaying the percentage of missing data for each column.

4.Dropping all rows with missing values.


5.Checking for duplicate data in the dataset.

6.Getting overall statistics from the dataset.

7.Displaying the movie names with a runtime greater than or equal to 180 minutes.

8.Finding the year with the highest average voting and revenue. Plotting average voting and revenue by year.

9.Calculating the average rating for each director.

10.Displaying the top 10 lengthy movie titles and their runtime in a bar plot.

11.Counting the number of movies per year and displaying them in a count plot.

12.Finding the most popular movie title based on the highest revenue.

13.Displaying the top 10 highest rated movie titles and their directors in a bar plot.

14.Displaying the top 10 highest revenue movie titles in a bar plot.

15.Calculating the average rating of movies per year and displaying them in a bar plot.

16.Investigating whether the rating affects the revenue using a scatter plot.

17.Classifying movies based on their ratings into four categories: "Excellent," "Good," "Average," and "Need Improvement."

18.Counting the number of action movies in the dataset.

19.Finding unique values from the "Genre" column and displaying them.

20.Counting how many films of each genre were made and displaying them in a bar plot.

21.Counting the total number of directors in the dataset.

22.Finding the total number of movies made by each director and displaying the top 5 directors who made the maximum movies.

23.Counting the total number of actors who worked in the movies and displaying their names.

24.Counting the number of movies in specific genres (Adventure, Action, Drama, Horror, Family, Comedy, Fantasy, and Romance) and displaying the counts in a horizontal bar plot.

# Note

1.Please note that the dataset used in this analysis is assumed to be named "IMDB-Movie-Data.csv" and should have specific columns for the code to work correctly.

2.If you use a different dataset or if the dataset structure has changed, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
